Common Concepts
Functional APIs vs. Semantic Data URLs
The site exposes the same functions through two different URL schemes. For example, to render a poster-style map of Deneb you can use either of these URLs:

https://travellermap.com/api/poster?sector=Deneb

https://travellermap.com/data/Deneb/image

The first URL is structured based on the function that is being performed, and takes parameters (defining data to operate on) and options (that refine the behavior); these URLs start with a /api/ prefix. The second URL is structured around the object being operated on, then specifies the data to retrieve; these URLs start with a /data/ prefix.

In this case, both URLs expose identical functionality. Not all functions exposed by the first ("api") form have a corresponding second ("data") form – for example, rendering arbitrary rectangles of space, or selecting a sector by x/y coordinates. On the other hand, the data URLs are much easier to remember and share. Both will be supported indefinitely.

Rendering Options and Styles
All of the APIs that produce images (Poster, Jump Map, Tile) as well as the site itself (including IFRAME) take an options parameter that is a bit field of rendering style options and a style parameter that names a visual style/color scheme for the map.

Options
The options are canonically defined in the script as flags that can be combined by adding the values together. The options parameter must be specified in decimal.

Tip: You can use the checkboxes in the table below to compute an options value. Reload the page to see the default options.

Option	Hexadecimal	Decimal	Notes
	SectorGrid	0x0001	1	Show sector grid.
	SubsectorGrid	0x0002	2	Show subsector grid.
	SectorsSelected	0x0004	4	At low scales, show only some sector names
	SectorsAll	0x0008	8	Show all sector names
	BordersMajor	0x0010	16	Show major region borders.
	BordersMinor	0x0020	32	Show minor region borders.
	NamesMajor	0x0040	64	Show major region names.
	NamesMinor	0x0080	128	Show minor region names.
	WorldsCapitals	0x0100	256	Show important worlds (capitals).
	WorldsHomeworlds	0x0200	512	Show important worlds (homeworlds).
	ForceHexes	0x2000	8192	Never render square hexes.
	WorldColors	0x4000	16384	Use additional world colors for Atm/Hyd.
	FilledBorders	0x8000	32768	Background colors for bordered regions.
Computed options value: options=9207 (try it)

Some flag values (not listed in the above table) have been deprecated. See the source code for more details. Because URLs may exist that reference them the flags cannot be reused. Going forward, distinct query parameters will be used to control rendering options. In addition, the flags do not correspond 1:1 to options shown on the main map page as the as the UI has evolved and simplified over time. Specifically, the pairs SectorGrid/​SubsectorGrid, BordersMajor/​BordersMinor, NamesMajor/​NamesMinor, and WorldsCapitals/​WorldsHomeworlds are always set/cleared together by one checkbox.

Behind the scenes, options values are one input to a style calculation; other inputs include the scale (see below). The options flags (e.g. SectorGrid) only apply at certain scales, per the following table:

Feature	1⁄32	1⁄16	1⁄8	1⁄4	1⁄2	1	2	4	8	16	32	64	128

Styles
Style values include:

poster examplestyle=poster
A color-on-black style that matches the "Spinward Marches" poster included with the Deluxe Traveller boxed set and the Imperium Map poster. This is the default.
print examplestyle=print
A color-on-white style best suited for color printing.
atlas examplestyle=atlas
A grayscale black-on-white style that matches the visual style of the Atlas of the Imperium and early supplements, best for black-and-white printing.
candy examplestyle=candy
A style designed by Wayne Peters that evokes interactive map displays from contemporary movies. Does not show world base or allegiance information, but does illustrate world size and hydrographics.
draft examplestyle=draft
A style reminiscent of GDW's original hand drawn draft of the Spinward Marches sector map. (A high resolution scan of the original is available on DriveThruRPG.)
FASA examplestyle=fasa
A style reminiscent of FASA's classic supplements and magazines.
Terminal examplestyle=terminal
A style reminiscent of retro-futuristic computer terminals.
Mongoose examplestyle=mongoose
A style similar to Mongoose Publishing's house style for Traveller maps.
Page and API
These options are available when calling rendering APIs, the main page, and IFRAME API.

dimunofficial=1
At scales where worlds are shown (dotmap or more), sectors with unofficial data will be dimmed
review=1
At scales where worlds are shown (dotmap or more), sectors will be tinted based on T5SS review status: official - red; in review - orange; unreviewed - yellow; preserve - green; apocryphal - magenta.
routes=0
Routes are not rendered (macro-scale or micro-scale)
rifts=0
Don't shade rifts. The default is to shade rifts.
sscoords=1
Hexes are numbered subsector style (0101-0810) instead of sector style (0101-3240)
allhexes=1
All hexes are numbered. The default is just to number hexes with worlds.
nogrid=1
Hex grid is not rendered. The default is to show a hex grid when zoomed in.
po=1
Population overlay: a yellow circle with area proportional to the population of each world is overlayed.
im=1
Importance overlay: a green circle representing the world's Importance is overlayed.
dw=1
Droyne World overlay: worlds with Droyne populations are annotated with ★, and worlds with Chirper populations are annotated with ☆.
an=1
Ancient World overlay: worlds with known Ancient sites are annotated with ☀.
mh=1
Minor Race Homeworld overlay: homeworlds of minor races are annotated with ✻.
stellar=1
A representation of the system's stars is shown instead of rendering world details. Sizes are not to scale.
hw=FN
hw=FN+
hw=FN-
hw=FN-M
hw=F:ABC
Highlight Worlds overlay: Worlds with a matching characteristic are highlighted.
The argument starts with a field name, one of St (starport) S (size) A (atmosphere) H (hydrographics) P (population) G (government) L (law level) T (tech level) Ix (importance) B (bases).

This is followed by either:

a value (field is N) (e.g. hw=T5 - TL 5)
a value and - (field is N or lower; e.g. hw=S5- - Size 5 or lower)
a value and + (field is N or higher; e.g. hw=T12+ - TL 12 or higher)
a value and - and another value (field in the range N to M; e.g. hw=A4-9 - Atmosphere 4-9)
: and a list of characters (starport and bases only; e.g. hw=B:ND - naval base or depot)
Note that for numerical patterns the values are decimal integers (possibly negative) or eHex. (example).

API Only
These options are available when calling rendering APIs, but not the main page or IFRAME API.

dpr=number
The image is rendered for the specified device pixel ratio. For example, specifying dpr=2 would produce an image at double the resolution, providing better quality for iOS "retina" and other high-density displays.
datauri=1
The image is returned as a base64-encoded Data URI rather than as binary data. This is useful when requesting images via POST via XHR to insert into HTML.

Go Links – short URLs for specifying a location on the map
API URLs:
https://travellermap.com/go/sector

https://travellermap.com/go/sector/hex

These URLs navigate the map page, and can be used instead of the longer ?sector=sector&hex=hex syntax.

Example:
https://travellermap.com/go/spin/1910

IFRAME – embed a map in your page
Usage:
<iframe src="URL" style="STYLE"></iframe>

Where URL is any main page URL, including query parameters and/or go links.

And STYLE is something like:

width: 200px; height: 200px; border: solid 1px black;

Query Parameters:
forceui=1
The page UI (search box, options buttons, etc) is shown. The default is to hide the UI when the map is embedded in another page.
Notes:
You use the same URL as for the main page. The site detects that it's running in an iframe and automatically hides the UI.
User preferences are ignored, so that you can control the styling and location with parameters.
You can drag with the mouse and zoom by using the mouse wheel or double-clicking (hold Alt and double-click to zoom out). You can even use the IJKL keys or arrow keys to scroll the map.
For sites such as Wikis that (for security reasons) do not allow embedding arbitrary IFRAMEs, see the Poster API instead.
The STYLE of the IFRAME element can be anything you want to match your site – the width and height are just examples
By default, the UI is hidden. To force the UI to be shown in an iframe, add the URL parameter forceui=1
Example:
<iframe
   src="https://travellermap.com/go/spin/1910?style=print"
   style="border: ridge 10px gray;">
</iframe>

Beta Features:
When the user clicks or double-clicks on the map, a message event will posted to the containing page. The data element of the event will have the form:
{source: "travellermap", type: "click", location: {x: 19: y: 10}}
or:
{source: "travellermap", type: "doubleclick", location: {x: 19: y: 10}}

https://travellermap.com/api/sec?sx=sx&sy=sy

Data URLs:
https://travellermap.com/data/sector

https://travellermap.com/data/sector/sec

https://travellermap.com/data/sector/tab

https://travellermap.com/data/sector/subsector

https://travellermap.com/data/sector/subsector/sec

https://travellermap.com/data/sector/quadrant

https://travellermap.com/data/sector/quadrant/sec

https://travellermap.com/data/sector/quadrant/tab

Parameters:
sector
sector name or T5SS abbreviation
subsector
A – P or name; optional – if specified, only UWPs for that subsector will be included
quadrant
one of Alpha, Beta, Gamma or Delta
sx
sy
sector in sector/hex coordinates
milieu
data milieu (e.g. M1900); optional
POST
The body of the request is sector data to be parsed. After successful parsing, the same data is returned but reformatted according to the selected options. This can be used to convert SEC data to T5 Tab Delimited for easier parsing by script. The format of the input data is "sniffed" – if it contains tabs it is assumed to be in T5 Tab Delimited format; if it contains extension field delimiters it is assumed to be in T5 Column Delimited format; otherwise, it is parsed as Legacy SEC format.
Parameters:
lint=1
Return an HTTP failure (400) if warnings or errors are found while parsing the sector data. The default is to silently ignore any lines with errors.
Options:
type=SecondSurvey
Data Format Definition The Traveller5 Second Survey format in human readable form: Hex, Name, UWP, Trade Classifications and Remarks, Extensions (Ix, Ex, Cx), Nobility (N), Bases (B), Travel Zone (Z), PBG, Worlds (W), Allegiance and Stellar. Note that fields may be blank if no official T5 data exists.
Second Survey is the default for /data/ URLs.

type=TabDelimited
Data Format Definition Full Traveller5 Second Survey data, in a more easily parsed format.
type=Legacy
Data Format Definition Legacy sector format: Name, Hex, UWP, Bases, Trade Classifications and Remarks, Travel Zone, PBG, Allegiance and Stellar.
Legacy format is the default for /api/ URLs

metadata=0
Don't include sector metadata as comments in the file
header=0
Don't include field definitions in the file
sscoords=1
Use subsector style (0101-0810) numbering instead of sector style (0101-3240)
Notes:
The column widths in SecondSurvey format are computed dynamically. The header and separator lines must be parsed to identify columns.
The column widths in the legacy format are defined in the header; data may be truncated to fit.
If you are programatically consuming the data, it is strongly recommended that you use TabDelimited format
If a jsonp query parameter is specified, the results are wrapped in a JSONP callback
Example:
https://travellermap.com/api/sec?sector=Spinward%20Marches&type=SecondSurvey

Metadata – retrieve metadata for a sector
HTTP Methods:
GET
The sector to output is specified some combination of the following URL parameters:
API URLs:
https://travellermap.com/api/metadata?sector=sector

https://travellermap.com/api/metadata?sx=sx&sy=sy

Data URLs:
https://travellermap.com/data/sector/metadata

Parameters:
sector
sector name or T5SS abbreviation
sx
sy
sector in sector/hex coordinates
milieu
data milieu (e.g. M1900); optional
POST
The body of the request is sector metadata to be parsed. After successful parsing, the same data is returned but reformatted according to the selected options. This can be used to convert XML or MSEC to JSON for easier parsing by script. The input data format is "sniffed" – if it has an XML prologue it is assumed to be XML format (example); otherwise, MSEC format (example) is assumed. JSON parsing is not supported.
Parameters:
lint=1
Return an HTTP failure (400) if warnings or errors are found while parsing the sector data. The default is to silently ignore any lines with errors.
Notes:
The default output format is JSON. To retrieve results in XML form, specify the HTTP header Accept: text/xml or include accept=text/xml in the query string.
The XML data is the same format as consumed by the Poster API when using HTTP POST, described in Sector Metadata File Format.
Example:
https://travellermap.com/api/metadata?sector=Spinward%20Marches

MSEC – generate sec2pdf metadata for a sector
API URLs:
https://travellermap.com/api/msec?sector=sector

https://travellermap.com/api/msec?sx=sx&sy=sy

Data URLs:

location in world-space coordinates
milieu
data milieu (e.g. M1900); optional
Notes:
The short Data URL form (/data/sector/hex) is an alias for jump 0 — only details for the specified system are returned.
Returns a list of worlds. Each world has the following fields (in no particular order), although fields may be omitted if blank:
Name
Hex
UWP
Bases
Remarks
Zone
PBG
Allegiance
Stellar
Ix
Ex
Cx
Nobility
Worlds
The default output format is JSON. To retrieve results in XML form, specify the HTTP header Accept: text/xml or include accept=text/xml in the query string.
Example:
Worlds within Jump-4 of Regina

Search – find worlds or regions by name or attributes
API URLs:
https://travellermap.com/api/search?q=QUERY

Parameters:
q
query string
milieu
data milieu (e.g. M1900); optional
Notes:
Perform a search of names for matching sectors, subsectors, worlds and labeled regions.
All searches are case-insensitive.
By default, only matches at the start of names or after spaces are returned. So "sol" will match "Sol", "Solomani Rim" and "Nowa Sol" but not "Marsol"
Wildcards: * and % can be used as a "zero or more of any character"; ? and _ can be used as "exactly one character". [] can be used for character ranges, e.g. [0-5] or [m-z] or [89ABC]. For example, "r*a" will match Regina.
Specifying a wildcard within a word turns off the "start of word" match. So "re*in" will not match "Regina" (but "re*in*" will).
Add exact: as a prefix to force an exact match, e.g. "exact:sol" will not match "Solomani Rim"
Add like: as a prefix to do a "sounds like" match, e.g. "like:tear" will find "Terra"
Specify more than one (space-delimited) word in the query to refine the search. Words are joined as logical and clauses. So "so ri" will match "Solomani Rim" (This combines strangely with wildcards; "sol* ri*" tries to find something matching both "sol*" and "ri*" so nothing will be found!)
Add uwp: as a prefix to a word to search the relevant fields. Examples:
uwp:a*
find worlds with class A starports
t* uwp:*f
find worlds with names beginning with T that are tech level F
Similarly, you can use pbg:, zone:, alleg: to match on PBG, Zone or Allegiance respectively.
Use stellar: to match a specific star type, e.g. stellar:"M? I*" for red giants, or stellar:"M? I*" stellar:D for red giants with white dwarf companions.
Use remark: to require a specific remark, e.g. remark:Hi to limit the results to high-population worlds.
Add in: as a prefix to a word to search the sector name. Examples:
t* in:spin
find worlds in Spinward Marches sector begining with T
uwp:*-f in:"Solomani Rim"
find worlds with tech level F in the Solomani Rim
Specifying a search query of XXXXXXX-X (seven alphanumeric characters, hyphen, one alphanumeric character) is a shortcut for uwp:
Searches are performed on individual items (sectors, subsectors, worlds). You cannot at present do scoped search such as "TL-F worlds in the Solomani Rim"
Results may appear for items with multiple names (e.g. Solomani Rim sector is known as Kushuggi in Vilani); this is a correct result, although the alternate name is not apparent on the site.
The default output format is JSON. To retrieve results in XML form, specify the HTTP header Accept: text/xml or include accept=text/xml in the query string.
Example:

Route – find jump routes between worlds
API URLs:
https://travellermap.com/api/route?start=LOC&end=LOC&jump=N

Parameters:
start
start location, e.g. SPIN 1910
end
end location, e.g. SOLO 1827
jump
jump distance (0 through 12, default is 2)
Options:
x
y
search position in world-space coordinates
milieu
data milieu (e.g. M1900); optional
wild=1
stops must have wilderness refueling (gas giant or liquid water present)
im=1
stops must be member worlds of the Third Imperium
nored=1
stops must not be restricted (TAS Red Zones)
aok=1
stops at anomalies/calibration points allowed
Notes:
Returns the shortest path found between the start and end worlds, with the given jump range, if any.
If the start/end location matches is given as SECTOR HEX, e.g. SPIN 1910 or Solomani Rim 1827 a world at that position will be used.
Otherwise, the nearest matching world with that name will be used, if any. The x, y coordinates are used to determine "nearest" in case of multiple matches.
If the source or end location do not exist, or there is no route found given the contraints, the request will fail with status 404 Not Found and a diagnostic message in the body.
Route restrictions (wild, im, nored) only apply to intermediate stops, not the start/end worlds.
The default output format is JSON. To retrieve results in XML form, specify the HTTP header Accept: text/xml or include accept=text/xml in the query string.

Regina Jump-4 Map
Appendix
Coordinate Systems – the varied esoteric x/y values
Different APIs use different coordinate systems. Future API updates may attempt to unify them, but the different coordinate systems will always be required, as different APIs provide different views on the site dataset.

Named Location
Some APIs support simple named locations, namely the name of a sector followed by a four-digit hex number (in xxyy form). This is inefficient, as the sector must be looked up by name, but is supported for convenience in APIs likely to be specified as URLs directly by humans rather than automatically generated.

The Traveller Map database of sector names accepts multiple spellings and languages for sector names ("Far Frontiers"/"Afachtiabr", "Dagudashaag"/"Dagudashag", etc) and is case-insensitive. Remember to URL-encode non-alphanumeric characters (e.g. spaces are %20).

Sectors mapped as part of the Traveller5 Second Survey (T5SS) process can be referenced by abbreviation as well, where the abbreviation is the first 4 letters (e.g. "spin" for the Spinward Marches), or 3 in the case of Ley Sector ("ley");

The Coordinates API will look up a sector/hex location and produce sector/hex coordinates suitible for further calculations. For convenience, the Jump Map API, Credits API, IFRAME API, and main page all accept named locations using sector and hex parameters.

Example: Regina is "Spinward Marches" "1910"

Sector/Hex Coordinates
Sector/Hex are the simplest numeric coordinates. These must be specified as a quartet of (sx, sy, hx, hy). The Core sector is at (0, 0), with positive X being Trailing and positive Y being Rimward. Hex coordinates are 1...32 and 1...40. Note that hx and hy must be specified separately.

Developers should be aware that many languages (C/C++, JavaScript, etc) will parse numbers with leading 0's as octal, so 08 and 09 give unexpected results. Use an appropriate parsing function with an explicit radix.

The Coordinates API will map a named sector / hex pair (such as "Spinward Marches", "1910") to the numeric quartet in this coordinate space. The Jump Map API and Credits API accept these coordinates using sx, sy, hx and hy parameters. The Coordinates API can also accept these coordinates using those parameters to map to World-Space coordinates.

Example: Regina (Spinward Marches 1910) is (sx=-4, sy=-1, hx=19, hy=10)

World-Space Coordinates
World-space coordinates are more compact than Sector/Hex coordinates, requiring just two numbers. The transformation is simple, and based around Reference (Core 0140). In this scheme, Reference is at (0, 0), positive X is Trailing and positive Y is Rimward. To convert Sector/Hex to world-space coordinates, simply compute the distance to Reference:

var SECTOR_WIDTH = 32;
var SECTOR_HEIGHT = 40;

// Core sector is (0, 0)
var REFERENCE_SECTOR_X = 0;
var REFERENCE_SECTOR_Y = 0;

// Reference is Core 0140
var REFERENCE_HEX_X = 1;
var REFERENCE_HEX_Y = 40;

function sectorHexToWorldXY(sx, sy, hx, hy) {
  var x = (sx - REFERENCE_SECTOR_X) * SECTOR_WIDTH
        + (hx - REFERENCE_HEX_X);
  var y = (sy - REFERENCE_SECTOR_Y) * SECTOR_HEIGHT
        + (hy - REFERENCE_HEX_Y);
  return { x, y };
}
This scheme is roughly comparable to the canonical Traveller ring/ray system, but is far more convenient given that the origin is within Charted Space. This coordinate system is used by the Credits API and the Jump Map API, which require selection of a specific hex. The coordinates are specified as x and y parameters

The Coordinates API will map a named location (sector, hex) or sector/hex coordinates (sx, sy, hx, hy) to world-space coordinates.

Example: Regina is (x=-110, y=-70)

Within Charted Space, to convert world-space coordinates to ring/ray:

ring = y + 10000
ray = x if x ≥ 0, or x + 62833 otherwise

Example: Regina is (-70 + 10000) ring/ray (-110 + 62833), or 9930 ring/ray 62723
Map-Space Coordinates
While world-space coordinates make a lot of sense for describing hexes, the fractional positioning required for precisely positioning the map dictates an additional map-space coordinate system. The conversion from world-space to map-space coordinates requires two steps:

Account for "odd" hexes being further coreward than "even" hexes – i.e. hex 1910 is further coreward than hex 2010. Also note that odd/even switch places between Sector/Hex and World-space since Reference is at 0140 and (0, 0) respectively.
Account for hexes being packed more tightly horizontally than vertically, at a ratio of cos(30°):1, and the Y-axis is inverted.
This is the only coordinate system with an inverted Y-axis. I don't know what I was thinking. I must have been asleep at the keyboard.

function isEven(n) { return (n % 2) === 0; }
var PARSEC_SCALE_X = Math.cos(Math.PI / 6); // cosine 30°
var PARSEC_SCALE_Y = 1;

function worldXYToMapXY(world_x, world_y) {
  var ix = world_x - 0.5
  var iy = isEven(world_x) ? world_y - 0.5 : world_y
  var x = ix * PARSEC_SCALE_X;
  var y = iy * -PARSEC_SCALE_Y;
  return { x, y };
}
This coordinate system is used by the main page and the IFRAME API when a precise view point is required. The coordinates are specified as x and y parameters.

Example: Regina is (x=-95.914, y=70.5)

Tile-Space Coordinates
Coordinates used by Tile API are designed so that the basic operations of dragging the map around and requesting new tiles are as simple as possible. If the tile scale, width and height remain constant, the tiles at (0, 0) and (0, 1) are adjacent, and the origin is the same as map-space coordinates. Positive X is Trailing, positive Y is Rimward.

x =  map_x * scale / width;
y = -map_y * scale / height;
Since this is effectively an image-space coordinate system, standard graphics tricks can be used. For example, to center a tile rendering on a map-space coordinate, use:

x = (  map_center_x * scale - ( width  / 2 ) ) / width;
y = ( -map_center_y * scale - ( height / 2 ) ) / height;
This coordinate system is only used by the Tile API. The coordinates are specified as x and y parameters.

Example: Regina would be centered in a 512x384, 48px/pc tile at (x=-9.4919375, y=-9.3125)

JSONP – Use data APIs in your Web pages
APIs on this site output CORS headers so if you know your users will be accessing your site using reasonably up-to-date browsers you can call the APIs directly via fetch or XMLHttpRequest rather than using JSONP trick described below.

Web browsers enforce a Same Origin Policy on content, to stop a page on evilhacker.com from scripting access to your bank account with your stored credentials. This is a good thing! Unfortunately, it also means that sites that want to cooperate have to jump through some hurdles. For example, you can't have a web page on your site that calls directly into one of the APIs on this site (via XMLHttpRequest) from JavaScript. Either the the sites need to have server-to-server communication (which is troublesome to set up, impractical in some circumstances, and introduces its own security issues) or they can play some tricks. JSONP is one of those tricks.

Web browsers allow pages to dynamically add content via script. They can even add references to additional script files, and those files can come from different sites. While a script cannot make AJAX calls to another site to retrieve data, it can cause a script from that site to be loaded just like a local script. The loaded script doesn't have any special abilities – it's still running within the domain of the page. The trick is to request a script with dynamically generated content – the data you wanted to request from the remote site in the first place!

The following APIs on this site support JSONP requests:

Coordinates
Credits
Jump Worlds
Search
Universe
Metadata
SEC (callback parameter is a single string containing linebreaks)
MSEC (callback parameter is a single string containing linebreaks)
To get a JSONP response, append &jsonp=callbackfn to your query string, where callbackfn is the name of the function you'd like the script to call. This is a function that should be pre-existing in your page, that takes an argument. The argument is the JavaScript value (usually an object with properties, sub-objects, arrays, etc).

For example, here's how you could implement a search function on your site:

// Call this function with a search query and callback:
function jsonp_example(q, cb) {
  var name = '_cbfun';
  var url = 'https://travellermap.com/api/search?q=' +
            encodeURIComponent(q) + '&jsonp=' + name;
  var script_tag = document.createElement('script');
  script_tag.setAttribute('src', url);
  window[name] = function(data) {
    window[name] = null;
    document.body.removeChild(script_tag);
    cb(data);
  };
  document.body.appendChild(script_tag);
}

// Example:
jsonp_example('Regina', function(data) {
    alert('Result count: ' + data.Results.Count);
});
